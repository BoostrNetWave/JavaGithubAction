**Before Apply Github Action In Platform Deploy or Running Server
**
Hereâ€™s how you can address this:

### 1. Ensure Java is Installed on the Server

1. **Check if Java is Installed:**
   SSH into your server and check if Java is installed:

   ```bash
   ssh your_username@your_server_ip
   java -version
   ```

   If Java is installed, it should display the version. If not, you need to install Java.

2. **Install Java (if not installed):**
   Install Java using your package manager. For example, on a Debian-based system:

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install default-jdk
   ```

   For CentOS/RHEL-based systems:

   ```bash
   sudo yum install java-11-openjdk-devel
   ```

3. **Verify Java Installation:**
   After installing Java, verify the installation:

   ```bash
   java -version
   ```

### 2. Update GitHub Actions Workflow

Once Java is installed on your server, ensure your GitHub Actions workflow is correctly configured to run the deployment script.

Here is an updated example of your workflow:

```yaml
name: Deploy

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Set up SSH agent
      uses: webfactory/ssh-agent@v0.5.3
      with:
        ssh-private-key: ${{ secrets.SSH_PRIVATE_KEY }}

    - name: Test SSH connection and Java installation
      run: ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no your_username@your_server_ip 'java -version'

    - name: Deploy script
      run: ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no your_username@your_server_ip 'java -jar path/to/your/deploy.xml'
```

### Debugging Steps

1. **Test SSH Connection and Java:**

   The `Test SSH connection and Java installation` step in the workflow checks if Java is correctly installed and accessible on the server.

2. **Ensure PATH is Set Correctly:**
   If Java is installed but still not found, ensure that the Java binary is in the system's PATH. You can do this by updating the `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile` file on your server:

   ```bash
   echo 'export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/java/bin' >> ~/.bashrc
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```

3. **Install Java in Workflow (Alternative Approach):**
   If you have control over the server setup and want to ensure Java is always installed, you can include a step to install Java directly in your GitHub Actions workflow (if running commands on a remote server, ensure permissions and sudo access are correctly handled):

   ```yaml
   - name: Install Java
     run: ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no your_username@your_server_ip 'sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y default-jdk'
   ```

### Summary Checklist

1. **Ensure Java is installed on the server:**
   - SSH into the server and install Java if not already installed.
   - Verify the Java installation with `java -version`.

2. **Update GitHub Actions Workflow:**
   - Add steps to test the SSH connection and Java installation.
   - Run the deployment script with Java.

# To demonstrate HelloWorld Program Execution On Server

To demonstrate a simple "Hello World" example in your GitHub Actions workflow, we can modify the workflow to execute a basic Java program that prints "Hello World". This example assumes you have a simple Java program packaged in a JAR file named `helloworld.jar`.

### Steps to Create and Deploy a Simple Java "Hello World" Program

1. **Create a Simple Java Program:**

   Create a Java file named `HelloWorld.java`:

   ```java
   public class HelloWorld {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           System.out.println("Hello, World!");
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Compile and Package the Java Program:**

   Compile the Java program and package it into a JAR file:

   ```sh
   javac HelloWorld.java
   jar cfe helloworld.jar HelloWorld HelloWorld.class
   ```

   Now you have a JAR file named `helloworld.jar` that contains your "Hello World" program.

3. **Upload the JAR File to Your Repository:**

   Add the `helloworld.jar` file to your GitHub repository.

4. **Create a GitHub Actions Workflow:**

   Create a workflow file (e.g., `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) to run the Java program on your server:

   ```yaml
   name: Deploy

   on:
     push:
       branches:
         - main

   jobs:
     deploy:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest

       steps:
       - name: Checkout repository
         uses: actions/checkout@v2

       - name: Set up SSH agent
         uses: webfactory/ssh-agent@v0.5.3
         with:
           ssh-private-key: ${{ secrets.SSH_PRIVATE_KEY }}

       - name: Test SSH connection and Java installation
         run: ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no your_username@your_server_ip 'java -version'

       - name: Copy JAR file to server
         run: scp -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no helloworld.jar your_username@your_server_ip:/path/to/your/directory

       - name: Run Hello World Java program on server
         run: ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no your_username@your_server_ip 'java -jar /path/to/your/directory/helloworld.jar'
   ```

### Explanation

1. **Checkout repository:** This step checks out the repository containing your JAR file.

2. **Set up SSH agent:** This step sets up the SSH agent and adds your SSH private key to authenticate with the server.

3. **Test SSH connection and Java installation:** This step verifies that the SSH connection and Java installation on the server are working.

4. **Copy JAR file to server:** This step copies the `helloworld.jar` file to your server.

5. **Run Hello World Java program on server:** This step runs the Java "Hello World" program on your server.

### Add SSH Key to GitHub Secrets

Make sure to add your SSH private key to GitHub secrets with the name `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY`:

1. Go to your GitHub repository.
2. Navigate to **Settings** > **Secrets and variables** > **Actions**.
3. Click **New repository secret**.
4. Name the secret `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY`.
5. Paste the contents of your SSH private key and click **Add secret**.

By following these steps, you can create a simple "Hello World" Java program, package it into a JAR file, and deploy it using GitHub Actions to run on your server.
